Booting Linux in non-root cells
===============================

Jailhouse exposes only a minimal environment to inmates of non-root cells.
Specifically on x86, the available resources are insufficient to boot standard
operating systems without modifications. This document describes the necessary
steps to configure Linux for booting in a non-root cell.


Kernel patches
--------------

We currently maintain a queue of patches to enable booting of Linux in an x86
non-root cell:

    git://git.kiszka.org/linux.git queues/jailhouse

Note that this branch may be rebased from time to time to move it to a more
recent kernel version or to cleanup and adjust the patches. The plan is to
push those patches upstream once their usefulness and correctness have been
confirmed.


Kernel configuration
--------------------

After checking out the above kernel branch, create a configuration that
contains at least the following adjustments:

- enable CONFIG_JAILHOUSE_GUEST
- disable CONFIG_SERIO
- disable CONFIG_PM_TRACE_RTC

Note that only 64-bit kernels are supported.

The proper UART configuration depends on the desired console setup. There is
currently no console available via the inter-cell communication channel, thus
it may be useful for testing purposes to configure the first physical UART for
the non-root cell. CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS should therefore be set to
1, and the root cell should avoid using the first UART for its own purposes
(the linux-x86-demo will revoke the access for the root cell). As the non-root
Linux cells have no IOAPIC support, there is also no IRQ support for the UART.
The patch queue currently contains a hack to disable the interrupt for that
UART and switch Linux to timer-based polling mode. If you don't use a UART,
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS should be set to 0.

In general, the non-root Linux kernel configuration should be tuned to disable
all unneeded drivers and features so that no undesired probing will take place
and the image size as well as the memory footprint is minimized.


Non-root Linux start
--------------------

The easiest way to start a non-root Linux inmate is via the jailhouse tool:

    jailhouse cell linux CELLCONFIG KERNEL [-i | --initrd FILE]
                         [-c | --cmdline "STRING"] [-w | --write-params FILE]

To create, load and start a Linxu cell and use the first UART as console, issue

    jailhouse cell linux /path/to/linux.cell /path/to/bzImage \
        -i /path/to/initrd -c "console=ttyS0,1152000"

Alternatively, you can prepare the required configuration image in advance via

    jailhouse cell linux /path/to/linux.cell /path/to/bzImage \
        -i /path/to/initrd -c "console=ttyS0,1152000" -w /path/to/linux-params

and then issue the basic tool commands on the target as printed by the command
above.
